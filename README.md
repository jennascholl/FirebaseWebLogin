# Overview

This is a simple account registration form which utilizes Firebase to store user information. To use, you simply enter in an email and password and create an account, logging out when you're done.

My purpose in creating this software was to gain a better understanding of cloud databases and to get some experience in using a database within a program. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

The cloud database I am using in this program is Firebase. 

The database I created using Firebase is an authentication platform which stores the user emails and signin information. It allows me to sign users in and out while authenticating them within the database.

# Development Environment

Visual Studio Code was used to write this code.

The code is made up of HTML, Javascript, and CSS. 

# Useful Websites

* Firebase Authentication Documentation (https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)
* Firebase web login and sign up using JavaScript (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IudOiOwppFA&t=373s&ab_channel=InfoTechWARforCoding)

# Future Work

* Remove the database's config information from public code
* Add functionality to the "Already have an account? Log in" link
